AUTOCONFIG for egdeswitches
===
Script made to push out config to dlink dgs1210-28 switches with a cisco 3560g as core.

For the run.pl and most other of the magic to work, LCS must be installed and setup with switches and coreswitches in the database.
There is yet not a script to create coreswitches. But there is a web system to add egdeswitches. Default you will find it at http://servername/place_switches
